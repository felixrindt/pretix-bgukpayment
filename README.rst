Organization Payment Provider
==========================

This is a plugin for `pretix`_. 
It adds a payment provider for organizations. A user can choose from a predefined list of organizations and also has to provide a member ID there. You can use it for university accounts or sponsor partners. If you want, set the payment fees to -100% to reflect that behavior.

I built this for a situation in which neither vouchers nor additional products were a suitable solution. Still, all texts shown to the user are customizable to make this plugin work in many different situations.

Development setup
-----------------

1. Make sure that you have a working `pretix development setup`_.

2. Clone this repository, eg to ``local/pretix-organizationpayment``.

3. Activate the virtual environment you use for pretix development.

4. Execute ``python setup.py develop`` within this directory to register this application with pretix's plugin registry.

5. Execute ``make`` within this directory to compile translations.

6. Restart your local pretix server. You can now use the plugin from this repository for your events by enabling it in
   the 'plugins' tab in the settings.
